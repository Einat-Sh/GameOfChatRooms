# GameOfChatRooms

This is a simple .NET Windows application in C# for a chatroom made with C#. 

UI framework used: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

The project is provided with a .sln file for easy access.

The project was made during my university days and relied on a database that was provided from the university at the time and therefor will not currently work as is.
